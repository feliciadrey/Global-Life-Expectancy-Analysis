# Global-Life-Expectancy-Analysis

Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of global life expectancy (2001‚Äì2019) using R, featuring an interactive Shiny dashboard and an infographic summarizing key findings.

---

## Overview
This project was developed for the **Data Mining & Visualization** course (2nd semester) and focuses on analyzing global life expectancy trends and their socioeconomic determinants. The work combines in-depth statistical exploration, interactive visualizations, and clear communication of insights through a public-facing infographic.

**Deliverables include:**
- **EDA in R Markdown** ‚Äì Trend analysis, factor correlations, and statistical summaries.
- **Shiny dashboard** ‚Äì Interactive exploration by region, income group, and influencing factor.
- **Infographic** ‚Äì Concise visual storytelling for non-technical audiences.
- **Documentation** ‚Äì Feature-by-feature guide to the dashboard
